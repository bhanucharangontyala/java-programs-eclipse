//import accessmodifier1.Access1;

//abstract
//  - this used to hide the implementation in abstraction 
//  - this is used for 
//      - classes,inner classes, interfaces -> for classes we cannot 
//        create the objects
//      - methods -> for methods there is no implementation

//static
//  - this modifier is used for inner classes, methods, variables, blocks
//  - the data members belongs to class itself
//  - this is used to represent data that shared across all instances of class

//strictfp
//  - this modifier is used for classes, interfaces, inner classes, methods
//  - this is used to tell the compiler to calculate the exact value of floating
//    points
//  - until java 16 we have to explicitly use the strictfp in classes and methods
//  - from java 17 we dont have to use strictfp explicitly , it has been 
//    deprecated and every classes and methods are strictly followed the 
//    floating point

//synchronized 
//  - this modifier can be used for blocks and methods
//  - we use this to achieve the synchronization in multithreading
//  - synchronization means the process are done one after another
//  - used to control access over shared resources
